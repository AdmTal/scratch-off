# AI Agent Instructions

This project is developed with AI assistance. These are the requirements for any AI agent working on this codebase.

## Prompt History Requirement

**CRITICAL:** After completing any task, you MUST update `prompt_history.md` with:

1. **Prompt number** - Sequential number
2. **Date** - The date of the prompt
3. **Prompt** - The exact user request (quoted)
4. **Result** - Brief summary of what was done

### Format

```markdown
## Prompt N

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Prompt:**

> [Exact user request here]

**Result:** [Brief description of changes made]

---
```

## Why This Matters

This project values transparency. The prompt history shows how the project was built, what was requested, and what was delivered. It's linked from the README for anyone curious about the development process.

## Other Guidelines

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Test changes in the demo page before committing
